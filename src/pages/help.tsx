                    <p>Setting up a connection between ClickNotes and your Notion account may seem intimidating, but it's very straightforward. I've broken down the process into three easy steps that should take no more than five minutes to complete.</p>

                    <Header>What is ClickNotes?</Header>
                    <p>ClickNotes is an open source project written in React intended on simplifying the note-taking of your movies, tvshows and books list. ClickNotes uses the TMDB, Google Books and NY Times API to fetch movies, tv shows and books which users can then save to their Notion databases using the Notion API - all this done in the single click of a button.</p>

                    <Header>What is Notion?</Header>
                    <p>Notion is a freemium productivity and note-taking web application developed by Notion Labs Inc. It offers organizational tools including task management, project tracking, to-do lists, and bookmarking. It's known for its flexibility, allowing users to create databases, manage projects, take notes, collaborate with teams, and more. Notion uses a block-based system where different types of contentâ€”text, images, databases, files, and moreâ€”are organized into blocks that can be manipulated and arranged in various ways. This flexibility enables users to create custom structures that suit their specific needs, whether it's for personal task management, team collaboration, or knowledge organization. Its adaptability makes it popular among individuals and teams looking for a centralized workspace that can be customized to fit their workflows.</p>

                    <Header>Step 1: Create an Integration in Notion</Header>
                    <p>In order to connect ClickNotes to your Notion account, you'll need to create an Integration in Notion. This is a simple process that requires no coding knowledge.</p>
                    <p>Once you've set up your account, navigate to the <span className="text-blue-600 hover:underline"><Link target="_blank" href="https://www.notion.so/my-integrations" aria-label='Your Notion Integrations'>notion.so/my-integrations</Link></span> section and click on "Create new integration". Give it a name and Notion will generate an Internal Integration Token for you. This token will be used to establish a connection between ClickNotes and Notion.</p>

                    <Header>Step 2: Duplicate the ClickNotes Official Templates</Header>
                    <p>I've created these Notion templates that you'll need to duplicate to store your content. The column names and types of these templates are compatible with the ClickNotes API, so make sure not to modify them. Feel free to add new columns, but note that they won't be affected by the ClickNotes API and will need to be filled in manually (e.g "My rating").</p>
